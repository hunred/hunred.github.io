<b>Transcription of video</u>:</b>
  <p>
  
  
One year ago, Kendrick Lamar released the album, DAMN

These are the fourteen tracks you find on that record.

The main message Kendrick Lamar argues can be heard in lyrics such as,




“Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?”
(From FEAR)


“I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA”
(From DNA)


“Love's gonna get you killed, but pride’s gonna be the death of you and you and me”
(From PRIDE)

An article from NPR explains,
His struggles serve as proxy for the human condition, a mirror image of America's own dark soul

This can be further proved with a voice clip found on the track FEAR,

“We are the Israelites, according to the Bible

The children of Israel, He's gonna punish us for our iniquities

For our disobedience, because we chose to follow other gods

That man chasten his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee

So, just like you chasten your own son

He's gonna chastise you because He loves you”

A quote from As The Badger Herald reveals,
Lamar drives through the album while discussing how modern life is shaped by these predetermined forces. 


Kendrick Lamar doesn’t leave us hopeless, he also gives moral advice to society,

The last song opens with these words,
“It was always me versus the world, until I found it's me versus me”


In an interview, he says this about his album,
“DAMN would be the idea, 'I can't change the world until I change myself’ … I would hope the listener can take heed ... and carry out their day to the best potential of themself”


Kendrick Lamar also writes a letter explaining his album, saying,
So in conclusion, I feel it's my calling to share the joy of God, but with exclamation, more so, the FEAR OF GOD. The balance. Knowing the power in what he can build, and also what he can destroy. At any given moment.



To help you connect these ethical arguments, I made a poem using all the track titles, to summarize the whole album, but first, you need to know that YAH is short for YAHWEH, which is God’s name,


My BLOOD has evil DNA

so YAH has tested my ELEMENT

making me FEEL a need for LOYALTY

because PRIDE kills my HUMBLE mind

while LUST prevents my LOVE.

I’m XXX and I no longer FEAR man, but GOD,

He saved DUCKWORTH.
